Welcome to AFINO's documentation!
=================================

AFINO is a tool to enable searching for frequency enhancements or
oscillations in time series data. AFINO was originally developed to
study solar flare oscillations and has been adapted to be of general
use.

AFINO is freely available, but should be treated as an experimental
scientific tool. Below we provide code reference for the current package.
